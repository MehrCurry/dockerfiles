===========

This project contains a set of usefull dockerfiles i'm often using.

Don't hesitate to pull-request or issue if errors are found !

How-to
------

You can build with Docker >= v1.0.0 "as-it" or if you have Vagrant with VBox, you can just vagrant up, going to /vagrant and then build with the embeded docker.

Which one to pick
-----------------

We got some different OS-based for thoses images. Each OS has it's own sub-list of images, check for each :
* [Busbox based](busybox-imgs/)
* [Debian based](debian-imgs/)
* [Centos based](centos-imgs/)
